In this project I have used survival analysis to study how the likelihood of the customer churn changes over time. I have also implementd a Random Forest model to predict the customer churn and deployed a model using flask webapp on Heroku. [App](https://churn-prediction-app.herokuapp.com/)

In this project I applied various classification models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest and LightGBM to detect consumers who will default the loan. SMOTE is used to combat class imbalance and LightGBM is implemented that resulted into the highest accuracy 98.89% and 0.99 F1 Score.

## Micro Projects
- ### Machine Learning:
    - [Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)](https://github.com/vignesh4005/Campus_Placement_Prediction/blob/main/README.md) : In this file, I have implemented simple Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm that predict a student's placement status based on academic and extracurricular factors
    - [Linear Regression](https://github.com/vignesh4005/Mobile_Price_Prediction_using_Linear_Regression/blob/main/README.md) : In this file, I implemented linear regression to predict the mobile price and got R2 score of 0.931

- ### SQL:
